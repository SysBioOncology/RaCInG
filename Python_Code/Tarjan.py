def StrongConnect(v, Adj, Ind, Stack, counter, SCC):
    '''
    The main function of Tarjan's algorithm. It takes in the adjancency matrix

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : int;
        A vertex number of the input graph.
    Adj : sparse matrix in csr format;
        The adjacency list of the input graph.
    Ind : 2 dimensional np.array with int entries;
        The index list of the exploration process of the input graph.
    Stack : List with int entries;
        The stack of recently explored vertices of the input graph. This needs
        to be a list because of an np.append bug during resursive functions. This
        throws out appended values again when move up in your recursion.
    counter : int;
        The (incrementing) counter of the number of recently explored vertices.
    SCC : List of lists with int entries;
        The strongly connected components of the input graph given in each list.

    Returns
    -------
    None. The function only updates all its input values recursively.
