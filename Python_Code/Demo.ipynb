With the variable *thresh = 5* we have indicated that we want the the five features with the lowest p-value to be highlighted and labelled if they are significant. For the pan-cancer result, we see there are some significant results above the red line. The five of those with the smallest p-value have been coloured and labeled. For the SKCM analysis we see there are no significant results, so no feature is coloured."

This is done with the *findLargeFold* and the *heatmap* funciton. The former will find the features for which the individual cancer type result differs the most from the pan-cancer result, while the latter will plot these results in a sort of scatter plot. Below an example for our data."

    "If in the previous analyses a certain feature stands out, we might want to look into the specific ligand-receptor pairs that cause the difference. To look into this, we can use the file *retrieveLigRecInfo.py* and the function *createPicture* within it. This function will calculate the probabilities of each LR-pair conditioned on conditioned on them being present in the chosen interaction. Finally, it will create a picture with the LR-interaction that got the highest score. Below, we will try it for the CAF - Tumor interaction in STAD. Note that the function has the possibility to input a third cell type (currently inputted as \"Not used\"). This cell type only needs to be inputted if you want to delve into the ligand-receptor pairs that make up a triangle interaction."

    "Finally, we can also construct circos plots based on the (kernel derived) direct communication values. For this, we have used a tool called \"circos\" (see: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/). This tool requires a .txt file as input to generate the plot. The file *circos.py* and the function *createCircosTxt* handles this. This function reads direct communcation values for a group of patients from a (numpy) .npz file, averages it over the patients belonging to a group, and creating the desired .txt file. Below is an example of first generating the .npz file and then using it to create the circos plot .txt file.\n",

    "&#x26A0; Currently, this function suffers from the issue that it cannot recognize patients from the .npz file. Thus, if the metadatafile does not include its patients in the same order as the .npz file, then the wrong meta-data label is assigned to them. The example below suffers from this issue."

    "In the above example we first indicated the cancer type, then the meta-group we wanted to generate a circos plot for, and then an inflation factor. This inflation factor needs to be specified, since circos requires the input to be integers. Direct communication values are numbers between 0 and 1, so the inflation factor multiplies all values in the direct communication list with a fixed factor to ensure each feature is fairly respresented (as a rounded integer) in the .txt file. The final three inputs are the name of the file the output is written to, the name of the folder where the metadata is located and the name of the metadata feature. You can now upload the output .txt file to the circos online envoronment and create the figure. This also concludes our demo. We did not cover the files *Tarjan.py* (used to calculate the size and composition of the giant strongly connected component in a graph) and *HPC_CLI.py* (a utility file used to generate SLURM scripts to run RaCInG in a HPC environment), since there are not of main interest when applying RaCInG. We hope that you will find RaCInG usefull for your own research!"
